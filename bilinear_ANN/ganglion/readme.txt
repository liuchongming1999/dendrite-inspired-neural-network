This simulation produces graphs similar to the left column of fig 3,
fig 6, and fig 10 B, C in

Sheasby, Brent W. and Jurgen F. Fohlmeister.  Impulse encoding
across the dendritic morphologies of retinal ganglion cells.
J.Neurophysiol. 81: 1685-1698, 1999.

Brent Sheasby's comments:

I've provided the *.hoc and geometry file of each model retinal ganglion
cells used in Sheasby, B.W. and Fohlmeister, J.F. 1999, where each
sub-directory represents 1 neuron.  They are divided into the directories
based on their morphological categories determined by Toris and Miller, 1995
(Large, Medium Complex, Small Simple, etc.). I have compressed them into 1
Winzip file (sheasbyfohlmeister1999.zip).  When uncompressing the files,
please use the option that preserves the directory structures.  ...

I did supply an additional speadsheet which provides both classification's 
(Toris and Miller,1995, and our new electrophysiological classification 
groups 1 - 4) neuron's active and passive properties. Each figure does 
provide the type of cell that was used, e.g. the "group 2,medium complex" 
cell in Fig. 6. Therefore, the spreadsheet may help narrow the search for the 
exact neuron used in the figure.
